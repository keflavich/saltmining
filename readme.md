Salt Mining Code
----------------

This repository grew somewhat haphazardly over the course of the data analysis process, so the notebooks aren't in a uniform state.

The `notebooks/` folder contains most of the analysis work.  The notebooks are large and contain all of the figures in the paper.

Notebooks making figures or doing full sample analysis:
 * `ALMA Archive - Salt Search.ipynb` contains code to search the ALMA archive for observations that could contain salty disks.  We analyze only a small subset of these in Paper I ("Salt-bearing disk candidates around high-mass young stellar objects").
 * `CommonSizeDiskFigure.ipynb` produces Figure 10 of Paper I
 * `LinesTable.ipynb` produces Table 2 of Paper I
 * `SummarizeSanhueza.ipynb` produces Figure 9 and Table 1
 * `SampleOverview.ipynb` produced an earlier version of some tables
 
 Notebooks analyzing individual disks:
 * `BeutherG351.ipynb` contains the analysis of G351 mm1, mm2, and mm12
 * `G17_Maud.ipynb` contains the analysis of G17
 * `KeiTanaka_YichenZhang_SaltSearch.ipynb` contains analysis of I16547A/B
 
 The following analyze DIHCA data for the labeled region:
* `Sanhueza18089.ipynb`
* `Sanhueza18162.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaG11.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaG333.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaG335.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaG351.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaG5.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaI16547.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaIG29.96.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaIG34.43.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaN6334I.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaN6334IN.ipynb`
* `SanhuezaW33.ipynb`
